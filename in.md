### 自我介绍，为什么报考

我来自内蒙古，本科专业是电子信息工程，我大约1年半以前逐渐对软件工程产生了兴趣，并且在去年的这个时候进一步选定了机器学习这个分支。一年来我首先完成了斯坦福的机器学习课程，随后学习了Udacity机器学习Nanodegree，在这个过程中意识到了机器学习和深度学习对未来世界的重要性，也对深度神经网络产生了浓厚的兴趣。但是学习的过程中我发现了我对算法实现和计算机系统和网络知识的欠缺，所以我就产生了回来读研的想法，用着两年的时间提升我对计算机基础知识的水平。



My name is Han Jialu, and I came from Inner Mongolia, my undergraduate major is the electronic information engineering.

About one years ago I started to learning Machine Learning and Deep Leaning. 

Over the past year, I finished the Stanford Machine Leraning course and Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. 

During the past year I gradually awared that Machine Learning and Deep Learning will have a great impact on the world. 

But Deep Neural Work requares a strong math and programming background. Which I'm not very confident with.

That is the mainly reason I rasigned my work and want to find a good graduate school to enhance my programming and math ability.

That's all.

4.会有好的影响

5.数学和编程不自信

6.所以辞职来考研了



### 介绍学校



### 介绍家乡

My hometown is Linhe city, at inner mongolar. it's a small city and 



我的家乡是内蒙古临河市，这是一个生活节奏很慢的农业城市，坐落于河套平原，盛产番茄和小麦。每年过年回家都可以从紧张的生活和学习中脱身感受一下这里轻松的生活环境，所以每年回家一次都相当于是一次休假。另一个有趣的方面是这里非常干旱，平均每年只下两场雨或雪。

My hometown is Linhe City, Inner Mongolia, which is a very slow pace of life agricultural city, located in the Loop, rich in tomato and wheat. Every year the New Year home can be from the tense life and learning to get out of here feel relaxed living environment, so once a year home is equivalent to a vacation. Another interesting aspect is that here is very dry, with an average of only two rain or snow each year.

It's a very intereting place to visite.

### 为什么成绩这么差



### 什么课程学习的比较好？

深度学习不错



### 讲个比较有意思的项目

我现





------

- 并查集


- 最短路径
- 🌲 C++

















# define MAX 255



int i

 unsifnged char c[MAX]

for(i=0;i<=max;i++) c[i]=i;
